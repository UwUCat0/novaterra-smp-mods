# novaterra-smp-mods
This is just a repo where the mods required to join Novaterra SMP can be found and installed.
You can find them on the releases page on this repo, or if you are a member of Novaterra SMP, you will be provided a script to install all of these automatically.

Although I have compiled these mods for the server, I did not make the mods themselves.
The credits for the mods included in the zip files distributed through this repo goes to their respective developers.
